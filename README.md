The database succesfully seeds and the app does listen, though I am only ever able to get the "Wrong Route!" message when I load it on Insomnia.  I have gone through every file several times and can't figure out what's wrong with it.  You can see the error in the .gif demo in assets.

All of the routes and models should correspond to their respective fields in the database.
